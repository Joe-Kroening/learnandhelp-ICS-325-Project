Rules of the game:

[1] To enroll in the classes, student must login first (create an account if it doesn't exist).
So, every student must create an account.

[2] We will have a "preferences" table that will have VARIABLE - VALUE pairs. For example,  "ACTIVE_REGISTRATION"  variable will have a value of "2024-2025"

[3] Classes now have a status flag. We will introduce another field called "Offered In" which will contain a academic year value.
And students can only regisger for the classes where "Offered In"  == ACTIVE_REGISTRATION value


[Use Case A] ============== How do students enroll in classes?


[1] Login first

[2] Enroll (in one class)  (students can register for only one class)

[3] Pay the fee (optional)


[Use Case B] ================ How do students see their current registration?

[Use Case C] =============== How do students see the payment status for their current registration?

Assume that students are paying through venmo / zelle / paypal etc. outside of the system.
And the "admin" will simply update the status of a student regisgtration as "paid".

[Use Case D] =============== How do admins see all the registrations for the "ACTIVE_REGISTRATION"?


[Use Case E] ================ How do students update / fix their enrollment?

[Use Case F] ================ How do students delete / remove their enrollment?

[Use Case G] ================ How do students see their registrations from prior years?

[Use Case H] ================ How do students pay the fee through the web site?

[Use Case I] ================ How to admins generate reports on the registration trends? Eg: Do all the students who registered last year  came back this year as well?
